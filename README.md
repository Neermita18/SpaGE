# SpaGE
## Predicting whole-transcriptome expression of spatial transcriptomics data through integration with scRNA-seq data 

### Implementation description

TBA

### Experiments code description

The benchmark folder contains the scripts to reproduce the results shown in the pre-print. The bencmark folder has five subfolders, each corresponds to one dataset-pair and contains the scripts to run SpaGE, Seurat-v3, Liger and gimVI. Additionally, we provide evaluation scripts to calculate and compare the performance of all four methods, and to reproduce all the figures in the pre-print.
